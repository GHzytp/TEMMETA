# TEMMETA

A TEM (meta)data manipulation library. Currently built mainly for working with Velox .emd files and basic processing and plotting of the results. Easy exporting to Hyperspy data formats is also supported for further processing.

## About
TEMMETA started as a simple tool to read and convert Velox EMD data. As I became more familiar with the analysis needs of other people and I started seeing the limitations of other tools, it became clear TEMMETA needed to become more useful and easy for other people to use, especially those with limited python experience. Therefore I completely rewrote the library and modeled the tools after those available in popular software such as Digital Micrograph and ImageJ. TEMMETA still does not have a user interface, but the functions and classes should be familiar and easy enough for people that they can start analyzing their data in no time inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## How to install
Work in progress
