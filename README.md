# Description

This repo contains some modules and functions (in the folder modules) with which one can import and export certain data from Velox .emd files. The focus is on images, metadata and spectrumstreams.  I tried my best to document the functionality of each
function, which you can query with the python function.

```
help(functionname)
```

It is not yet perfect however and many improvements can still be made. If you can't get it to work or you found some glaring bug let me know. I highly recommend looking at the included jupyter notebooks for examples. The links to the data that are included will not 
work on your computer, so exchange these for your own data.
